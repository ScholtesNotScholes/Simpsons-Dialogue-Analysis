# Simpsons-Dialogue-Analysis

Fun side project to practice some NLP and working with text data.

Using data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pierremegret/dialogue-lines-of-the-simpsons), analysed how frequently main members of the Simpsons family refer to each other by name in the show.
